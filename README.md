# HGVBid – Reverse Recruitment Platform for HGV Drivers

A modern, full-stack SaaS platform revolutionizing how HGV drivers find work.

## The Problem

HGV drivers often remain invisible to potential employers. HGVBid flips the script—drivers post anonymously, companies find them.

## The Solution

- **Anonymous Driver Registration:** Drivers specify desired wages and locations without risking their current job
- **AI-Powered Wage Advisor:** Real-time salary guidance powered by OpenAI
- **Smart Matching:** Companies search and contact drivers directly
- **B2B Subscription Model:** Companies pay for access to the driver pool

## Key Metrics

- **Early Growth Stage:** Onboarding 1,000+ drivers before B2B launch
- **Tech Stack:** 96.1% TypeScript (production-grade code)
- **Performance:** Serverless architecture with Neon + Drizzle ORM

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API
- **Infrastructure:** Neon Serverless, Drizzle ORM
