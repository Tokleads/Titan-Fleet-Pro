REPLIT PROMPT — Transport Manager Dashboard (Desktop)

You are a senior product engineer + UX lead building a Transport Manager Dashboard for a UK HGV fleet platform. The driver PWA already exists. Now build the manager web app with a premium enterprise feel (calm, sharp typography, consistent spacing, excellent tables/filters), using the existing backend and database. Do not change driver flows.

Goal

A transport manager can:

See inspection compliance at a glance

Review submitted inspections and defects (with photos)

Track open defects and status

Export/share reports (PDF/CSV)

Manage vehicles/trailers/checksheets (basic CRUD)

Search quickly by VRM, driver, date

View history beyond 7 days

Audit fuel/AdBlue uploads (receipts + card photo + mileage) without price field visible to drivers

Tech requirements

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite

UI: Tailwind + shadcn/Radix (same design tokens as driver app but tuned for desktop)

Charts: use recharts (lightweight) OR simple KPI cards if charts are overkill

Routing: react-router

Auth: separate Manager login (email/password OR company code + manager pin). Keep it minimal but secure.

Backend: Express + Postgres (existing). Add endpoints only if missing.

File storage: do not store files yourself. Support:

S3-compatible later, but for now:

Upload to server then forward to Google Drive via a folder webhook/config OR store upload URLs in DB.

Provide a clean interface to “connect Google Drive” using an admin-provided folder link / ID (configuration screen).

If full Drive OAuth is too big, implement manual folder ID config + service account approach placeholder.

Information architecture (must implement)
1) Manager Dashboard (Home)

KPI cards:

Inspections today

Inspections overdue (by vehicle)

Open defects

Vehicles with MOT due soon

“Attention Required” list (top 10):

Open defects unassigned / high severity

Overdue inspection vehicles

Quick search: VRM / trailer ID / driver name

2) Inspections

A data table with:

Date/time

VRM

Driver

Type (Safety / End of shift / Trailer)

Result (Pass / Defects)

Completion %

View button
Filters:

Date range

VRM

Driver

Type

Only with defects
Row click opens Inspection Detail.

3) Inspection Detail

Header: VRM + make/model + time + driver

Progress summary (x/y items)

Sections list (accordion)

Defects panel:

defect description

photos gallery (click to expand)

status: Open / In Progress / Resolved

assign to workshop/engineer (simple text field ok)

add internal notes

Download/export: PDF + CSV

4) Defects

A board or table view:

Status columns (Open/In Progress/Resolved) OR table with status filter

Severity (Low/Med/High)

Linked VRM + inspection reference

SLA indicator (age)

Attachments (photos)

Bulk actions: mark resolved, export

5) Fuel / AdBlue Log

Table with:

Date/time

VRM

Driver

Mileage

Fuel or AdBlue

Receipt photo(s)

Fuel card photo

Station name (optional)

Notes
Important: Driver does NOT input price; manager may optionally see price if present in data, but UI defaults to hidden.

6) Fleet (Vehicles & Trailers)

CRUD (basic, fast):

Vehicles: VRM, make, model, depot, MOT date, service date, status

Trailers: trailer ID/VRM equivalent, type, status

Ability to import CSV (optional, but add placeholder UI)

7) Checksheet Builder (Phase 1 minimal)

Manager can view existing checksheets and enable/disable

Don’t build a full builder unless easy

Must support:

“Safety check”

“End of shift”

Trailer-only checks

8) Company Settings

Branding: company name, logo upload, primary colour

User management: add/remove managers (simple)

Google Drive integration settings:

“Drive folder ID”

test connection button (or placeholder)

show how driver uploads map to folders (e.g., /Receipts/YYYY-MM/DD/VRM)

UX/UI quality bar (must)

Desktop-first layout with left sidebar nav (collapsible)

Sticky top bar with search + company switch (if multi-tenant)

Tables:

proper row density toggle (comfortable/compact)

sticky header

column sorting

filters in a drawer or top filter bar

Empty states and skeleton loading everywhere

Polished component states: hover, active, focus-visible, disabled

Microcopy uses UK fleet language (VRM, MOT, defect, inspection)

Export buttons always visible on detail pages

All dates UK format (DD/MM/YYYY), time 24h

Data model expectations

Use existing tables if present. If missing, create minimal tables:

companies

managers

drivers (optional)

vehicles

trailers

inspections

inspection_items

defects

uploads (receipt/fuel card/defect photos)

fuel_logs
Ensure multi-tenant boundaries (company_id everywhere).

Security & compliance basics

Manager routes protected (auth guard)

Audit log table (minimal): manager_id, action, entity, timestamp

File upload validation: file type and size limits

No sensitive secrets in frontend; use env vars

Output requirements

Implement the manager dashboard in a new folder: /manager-app OR as a new route group in the same Vite app with separate layout.

Provide seed data for demo (1 company, 5 vehicles, 3 drivers, 10 inspections, 6 defects).

Ensure it runs locally with one command.

Provide a short README with:

how to create a manager user

how to set company branding

how to configure Google Drive folder ID

Now build it to a production-quality standard.

If you want, tell me which style you want for the manager dashboard:

“FleetCheck-like clean corporate” (light, calm, lots of whitespace), or

“Industrial premium” (slightly darker UI, more “logistics command centre”).

Either way, we can also make it fully rebrandable so you can resell it to 100+ companies fast.
