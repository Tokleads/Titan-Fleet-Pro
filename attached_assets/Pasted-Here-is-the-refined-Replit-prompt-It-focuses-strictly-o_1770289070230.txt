Here is the refined Replit prompt. It focuses strictly on a **single, interactive UI component** rather than a full landing page, making it much easier to drop into your existing app.

### Replit Agent Prompt

**Role:** Expert UI/UX Developer.
**Task:** Build a single, high-converting "Pricing Section" component for a React/Tailwind app.

**Component Requirements:**

1. **The Layout:** - A clean horizontal grid with 4 cards: **Starter (£59)**, **Growth (£129)**, **Pro (£249)**, and **Scale (£399)**.
* Use a "Most Popular" badge on the Growth card.
* All prices must clearly state: **"Total price - No VAT applicable"**.


2. **The Logic (Interactive Slider):**
* Place a sleek slider above or below the cards titled: **"How many vehicles are in your fleet?"** (Range: 1–150).
* **Overage Calculation:** - Base price starts at £59 (up to 10 vehicles).
* For every vehicle above 10, add **£6.00**.
* As the user slides, dynamically highlight the card that offers the best value.
* Example: If the user slides to 12 vehicles, show the total as **"£71.00/mo"** (£59 base + £12 overage).




3. **Visual Cues:**
* Use **Lucide-React** icons for feature lists (e.g., Green checkmarks).
* Use a professional UK-centric "Compliance Navy" (#0f172a) and "DVSA Green" (#22c55e) color scheme.
* Add a small comparison box below the slider: **"TitanFleet (£0 Setup) vs. Hardware Trackers (£300+ Setup Fee)"**.


4. **Tech Details:**
* Framework: **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions on the slider.

### How this works for you:

* **The £6 Overage:** The slider eliminates the "11th vehicle shock" by showing the math in real-time.
* **No VAT:** By stating "Total price," you avoid the awkwardness of not being VAT registered. Small hauliers will see it as a 20% saving compared to competitors who add VAT on top.
* **Conversion:** The comparison box at the bottom handles the biggest objection ("Why is this £59?") by reminding them they aren't paying for hardware.
