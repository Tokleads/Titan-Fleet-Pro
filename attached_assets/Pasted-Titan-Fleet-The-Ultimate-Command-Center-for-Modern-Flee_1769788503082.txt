Titan Fleet: The Ultimate Command Center for Modern Fleets
One Subscription. Total Control. Zero Complexity.
Why pay for three separate subscriptions? Titan Fleet consolidates professional vehicle compliance, automated HR timesheets, and advanced satellite tracking into a single, high-performance terminal. Built for the heavy-duty demands of logistics, Titan Fleet turns data into your most powerful asset.

1. The Intelligence Hub (Live GPS & Risk Monitoring)
Don't just track your vehicles—anticipate their needs. Our high-fidelity satellite link provides 5-minute telemetry updates, giving you real-time visibility into every unit.

Active Tracking: Real-time coordinates, speed, and heading data.

The 30-Minute Stagnation Alert: Our intelligent monitor flags any unit that remains stationary for more than 30 minutes, allowing transport managers to check on driver safety or address operational delays instantly.

Safety Analytics: Monitor driving performance and generate safety scores to protect your brand and your bottom line.

2. Automated Payroll (Depot Geofencing)
Eliminate paper timesheets and manual entry errors. Titan Fleet uses high-precision geofencing at your core sites—Head Office, Clay Lane, and Woodlands—to automate your entire payroll workflow.

Invisible Clock-In: Drivers are automatically signed into their shift the moment they enter a depot radius.

Precise Logging: Shifts close automatically upon exit, calculating exact minutes worked.

Payroll-Ready Exports: Generate and download comprehensive CSV reports for instant invoicing and receipting.

3. Titan Command (Two-Way Dispatch)
Bridge the gap between the office and the road. Our integrated "Titan Command" hub allows Transport Managers to broadcast urgent site-wide alerts or send direct, encrypted instructions to individual driver terminals.

Global Broadcasts: Push urgent traffic or site updates to the entire fleet simultaneously.

Direct Push: Send 1-to-1 instructions with instant delivery confirmation.

Rest easy knowing your fleet is fully compliant. We provide a like-for-like replacement for industry-standard compliance software, including:

Digital Walk-around Checks: Real-time defect reporting from the driver's app.

Maintenance Monitoring: Automated alerts for MOTs, Services, and Licence expiries.

Full Registry Control: Centralized management for vehicles, drivers, assets, and fuel cards.
