1. Almost none of the API is actually protected.
The requireAuth middleware exists in the code but is used only 6 times across the entire backend. That means the vast majority of your 213 API endpoints — vehicles, drivers, inspections, pay rates, timesheets, fuel data — can be accessed by anyone on the internet without logging in at all. The multi-tenancy guard (which stops Company A seeing Company B's data) only fires if (req.user) — meaning if there is no logged-in user, it skips the check entirely. This is a serious security vulnerability, not a minor one.
2. The codebase has a significant architectural problem.
The entire backend lives in a single file — server/routes.ts — that is 5,996 lines long. This is what developers call a "monolith" or "God file." It is very difficult to maintain, debug, or hand to another developer. Professional codebases split this into dozens of focused files. You have started doing this (there are separate files like vehicleManagementRoutes.ts, userRolesRoutes.ts) but the main file was never properly broken up.
3. Input validation is sparse.
Only 13 out of 213 routes use schema validation (Zod). The rest accept whatever data is sent to them. This means malformed or malicious data can reach your database.
4. The code was clearly built fast, not built clean.
There are 61 uses of TypeScript any (which defeats the purpose of using TypeScript), 12 TODO/FIXME comments left in production code, and 8 console.log debug statements still in the main routes file. These are signs of code written quickly under pressure, not code written to a professional standard.

The honest answer is: if you showed this to a non-technical investor or a haulage company owner, they would be impressed — and rightly so. If you showed it to a senior software engineer for a technical due diligence review, they would flag the security issues immediately and have concerns about the architecture. The good news is that the security problems are fixable, and the features are real. But it would be wrong to tell you it is production-ready at enterprise scale without those fixes.
The codebase has extensive features, but most routes lack proper security, as `requireAuth` is used only 6 times. The architecture is monolithic and needs refactoring for professionalism.
