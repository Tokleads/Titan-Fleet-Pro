Where it falls just short of Tide / Monzo (and why)

This is the important bit.

1. It’s polite, but not confident yet

Tide / Monzo UIs own the screen.

Your dashboard currently reports data —
Monzo dashboards reassure the user.

Example difference:

Now:

Inspections Today
0

Tide-style:

Inspections today
All done ✓

Same data. Very different emotional effect.

👉 Action:
Add micro-copy states:

“All clear today”

“No open defects”

“You’re compliant”

This is huge psychologically.

2. The numbers feel static (Monzo hates static)

Monzo dashboards feel alive even when nothing changes.

You can fix this without charts.

Ideas:

“0 open defects — last issue resolved 3 days ago”

“15 vehicles active — 100% reporting this week”

“MOTs due — next due in 12 days”

👉 This makes it feel managed, not logged.

3. Icon colour hierarchy needs tightening

Right now:

Blue

Yellow

Red

Green

All at equal visual weight.

Monzo/Tide rule:

Neutral first

Colour only for meaning

Recommendation:

Make default cards neutral grey/blue

Reserve:

Red = action required

Amber = upcoming risk

Green = explicitly “safe”

That way colour signals, not decorates.

4. The header area could do more emotional work

At the top you have:

Dashboard
Fleet compliance overview

This is fine — but Monzo would do:

Dashboard
You’re compliant today

Or dynamically:

“No issues detected”

“2 items need attention”

“All vehicles reported”

👉 This is status language, not software language.

5. It’s missing 1 “trust flex” element

Tide and Monzo always reinforce trust somewhere subtle.

You could add one of these:

“Audit-ready DVSA records”

“Records stored securely for 15+ months”

“Exported in DVSA-friendly format”

“Every inspection time-stamped & driver signed”

Not a banner.
Just a quiet line under the dashboard title.

Verdict (honest)

If a Tide or Monzo designer saw this, they would not cringe.

They would say:

“This is solid. Needs a bit more confidence and warmth.”

That’s a very good position to be in.

You’re not fighting bad design — you’re polishing good design.

What I’d do next (in order)

Add positive state copy (“All clear”, “You’re compliant”)

Add one trust reinforcement line

Reduce colour usage to make alerts pop

Add “last activity” or “trend” micro-context

Do nothing else — don’t overbuild
